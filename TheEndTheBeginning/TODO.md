## üîß DEVELOPMENT NOTES

### Current Architecture
- **JavaFX GUI** with FXML layout files
- **MVC Pattern** - MainControllerNew handles UI, Player/Monster handle data
- **Event-driven** input processing with state management
- **Modular design** with separate classes for different game aspects

### Known Issues
1. **Class naming inconsistency** - MainControllerNew.java vs MainController class (FIXED)
2. **Duplicate Monster classes** - gameproject.Monster vs main.model.Monster (RESOLVED)
3. **Legacy GameState** - Old compatibility layer needs cleanup
4. **Error handling** - Limited user feedback for invalid inputs

### Code Standards
- Use modern Java features (switch expressions, var keyword where appropriate)
- Follow JavaFX best practices for UI development
- Maintain consistent naming conventions
- Document all public methods with JavaDoc
- Keep methods under 50 lines when possible

### Testing Strategy
- Manual testing for all game paths
- Unit tests for core game logic (Player, Monster, Item classes)
- UI testing for all interactive elements
- Performance testing with extended gameplay sessions
