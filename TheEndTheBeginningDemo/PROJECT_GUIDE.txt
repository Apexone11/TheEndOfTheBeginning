Project Guide: Turning DungeonScape into a small JavaFX project

Goal
- Convert the text-based DungeonScape prototype into a simple JavaFX application.
- Keep the game lightweight: scene-based UI with buttons and text areas for dialogue.

Why JavaFX?
- JavaFX is bundled or available for Java and is well-suited for simple 2D/GUI apps.
- It supports layout panes, buttons, text areas, and images without heavy game engines.

Suggested project structure (Maven or Gradle recommended)
- src/main/java/com/yourname/dungeonscape/
    - App.java              -> JavaFX launcher (main class)
    - MainController.java   -> Controls scene swaps and main UI logic
    - model/
        - Player.java       -> Player stats and methods
        - Monster.java      -> Monster stats and behavior
        - Item.java         -> Item definitions (health, armor, weapon)
    - view/
        - main.fxml         -> Main scene layout (TextArea for story, Buttons for choices)
- src/main/resources/
    - styles.css            -> UI styling
    - images/               -> Any art or icons
- README.md
- build.gradle or pom.xml

How to start (quick steps)
1) Create a new Maven or Gradle project in your IDE (IntelliJ IDEA or VS Code with Java extensions).
2) Add JavaFX dependencies (if using Java 11+ you need to add the JavaFX SDK modules). Example with Maven coordinates: org.openjfx:javafx-controls, javafx-fxml.
3) Move game logic out of `main()` into `Player`, `Monster`, and a `GameService` class.
4) Create a simple `main.fxml` with:
   - a `TextArea` (read-only) for game text and story
   - a few `Button`s for user choices
   - a side `VBox` or `GridPane` to show `Player` stats
5) Hook UI buttons to methods in `MainController` that call your `GameService` to progress the game.
6) Keep the UI responsive: long-running tasks (if any) should run in background threads.

Design tips
- Keep actions atomic: clicking a button triggers a single game action (move, check, fight).
- Use a `ListView<String>` or `TextArea` and append lines instead of replacing text, so players can read history.
- Use simple dialogs for choices or an action bar with clearly labeled buttons.
- Make fonts and spacing readable; use margins and padding.

Learning resources
- Official JavaFX docs and samples: https://openjfx.io/
- Tutorials: "JavaFX Tutorial - Full Java GUI" on YouTube (search for OpenJFX)
- Simple starter templates: search "JavaFX FXML starter" in your IDE marketplace

Notes for Abdul
- Keep changes small and test often. Move code to classes gradually.
- If you want, I can scaffold a minimal JavaFX project for you and show how to wire a single fight event to the UI.

Good luck â€” this is a great project to learn Java GUI development!
