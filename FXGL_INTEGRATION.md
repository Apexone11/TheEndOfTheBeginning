# FXGL Integration Guide

## About FXGL

**FXGL** (JavaFX Game Library) is a comprehensive game development framework built on top of JavaFX. It provides powerful features for creating 2D and simple 3D games.

### Official Resources
- **GitHub**: [https://github.com/AlmasB/FXGL](https://github.com/AlmasB/FXGL)
- **Documentation**: [https://github.com/AlmasB/FXGL/wiki](https://github.com/AlmasB/FXGL/wiki)
- **Samples**: [https://github.com/AlmasB/FXGLGames](https://github.com/AlmasB/FXGLGames)

## Current Status

FXGL has been added to the project dependencies (version 17.3) but is **not yet actively used** in the game code. This is intentional - it's available for future enhancements.

## Why FXGL?

FXGL provides many features that can enhance The End The Beginning:

### Graphics & Animation
- Sprite management and animation
- Particle effects for combat and magic
- Smooth transitions and animations
- Advanced rendering capabilities

### Game Development Features
- Entity-component system
- Physics engine (if needed for future gameplay)
- Audio management (music and sound effects)
- Asset management
- Scene management
- Input handling

### UI Enhancements
- Advanced UI components
- Dialogue systems
- Inventory screens
- Achievement displays
- Menu systems

## Integration Roadmap

### Phase 1: Research (Current)
- [x] Add FXGL dependency to pom.xml
- [ ] Review FXGL documentation and samples
- [ ] Identify specific features to use
- [ ] Plan integration strategy

### Phase 2: Basic Integration
- [ ] Create FXGL-based prototype alongside current game
- [ ] Test compatibility with existing JavaFX code
- [ ] Implement simple animations or effects
- [ ] Evaluate performance impact

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features
- [ ] Add particle effects for combat
- [ ] Implement sprite-based animations
- [ ] Enhance UI with FXGL components
- [ ] Add sound effects using FXGL audio system

### Phase 4: Full Migration (Optional)
- [ ] Consider full FXGL game architecture
- [ ] Migrate game logic to FXGL's entity system
- [ ] Use FXGL's scene management
- [ ] Leverage FXGL's game loop

## How to Use FXGL

### Basic FXGL Game Structure

```java
import com.almasb.fxgl.app.GameApplication;
import com.almasb.fxgl.app.GameSettings;
import com.almasb.fxgl.dsl.FXGL;

public class MyFXGLGame extends GameApplication {
    
    @Override
    protected void initSettings(GameSettings settings) {
        settings.setWidth(900);
        settings.setHeight(700);
        settings.setTitle("The End The Beginning");
        settings.setVersion("3.0");
    }
    
    @Override
    protected void initGame() {
        // Initialize game entities and world
    }
    
    @Override
    protected void initUI() {
        // Initialize UI components
    }
}
```

### Adding Particle Effects

```java
import com.almasb.fxgl.particle.ParticleEmitter;
import com.almasb.fxgl.particle.ParticleSystem;

// Create particle effect for combat
ParticleEmitter emitter = ParticleEmitters.newExplosionEmitter(50);
emitter.setBlendMode(BlendMode.ADD);
emitter.setSourceImage(texture("particle.png"));
```

### Sound Effects

```java
import static com.almasb.fxgl.dsl.FXGL.*;

// Play sound effect
play("sword_swing.wav");

// Play background music
getAudioPlayer().loopBGM("dungeon_theme.mp3");
```

## Integration Tips

### 1. Gradual Adoption
- Start by using FXGL for new features only
- Keep existing JavaFX code working
- Migrate features one at a time

### 2. Asset Management
- Use FXGL's asset system for resources
- Organize assets in `src/main/resources/assets/`
- Structure: `assets/textures/`, `assets/sounds/`, `assets/music/`

### 3. Performance
- Test performance impact on different systems
- FXGL adds overhead but provides optimization
- Use profiling to identify bottlenecks

### 4. Documentation
- Document which features use FXGL
- Keep both FXGL and non-FXGL versions during transition
- Update BUILD.md with FXGL-specific requirements

## Current Game Architecture

The game currently uses:
- **JavaFX** for UI (FXML-based)
- **CSS** for styling
- **Custom game logic** in controllers
- **Plain text** save files

FXGL can enhance without replacing this architecture.

## Notes for Developers

- FXGL is **optional** for contributing to this project
- Current game works fine without FXGL features
- FXGL integration is for **future enhancements**
- Feel free to experiment with FXGL in separate branches
