# Game Engine Integration Notes

## Current Status

This document tracks game engine and framework integrations for The End The Beginning project.

## Integrated Frameworks

### ❌ FXGL (JavaFX Game Library) - REMOVED in v3.1.0
- **Status**: Removed in version 3.1.0
- **Previously**: Integrated in version 3.0.1, removed in 3.1.0
- **Reason for Removal**: Simpler codebase, lighter dependencies, pure JavaFX sufficient for current needs
- **Official Site**: [https://github.com/AlmasB/FXGL](https://github.com/AlmasB/FXGL)
- **Note**: May be reconsidered in future versions if advanced game features are needed

### ✅ JavaFX (Pure Implementation)
- **Status**: Core framework (since v1.0, now exclusive since v3.1.0)
- **Version**: 20
- **Purpose**: UI, graphics, application framework, all game functionality
- **Official Site**: [https://openjfx.io/](https://openjfx.io/)
- **Why**: Modern, cross-platform UI framework sufficient for our text-adventure game

## Researched but Not Integrated

### ⚠️ AdaxEngine
- **Status**: Not integrated
- **Research Date**: October 2025
- **Findings**: AdaxEngine does not appear to be a documented or publicly available game engine for JavaFX as of this date.
- **Alternative**: FXGL provides similar or better functionality and has active development and community support.
- **Decision**: Use FXGL instead for game engine features

## Framework Comparison

| Framework | Status | Purpose | Pros | Cons |
|-----------|--------|---------|------|------|
| JavaFX | Active | UI Framework | Stable, cross-platform, well-documented | Not game-specific |
| FXGL | Integrated | Game Library | Game-specific features, active development, good docs | Adds dependencies |
| AdaxEngine | Not Available | Unknown | N/A | No public documentation or repository found |

## Future Considerations

### Other Game Frameworks (For Reference)

#### LibGDX
- **Type**: Cross-platform game framework
- **Language**: Java
- **Pros**: Mature, feature-rich, excellent performance
- **Cons**: Different architecture, would require major refactoring
- **Decision**: Not needed - FXGL sufficient for our needs

#### jMonkeyEngine
- **Type**: 3D game engine
- **Language**: Java
- **Pros**: Full 3D support, scene graph, physics
- **Cons**: Overkill for 2D text-based game, steep learning curve
- **Decision**: Not needed for this project

## Integration Guidelines

When considering new frameworks:

1. **Research Thoroughly**
   - Check GitHub stars and activity
   - Review documentation quality
   - Look for community support
   - Verify compatibility with Java 17 and JavaFX 20

2. **Evaluate Need**
   - Does it solve a real problem?
   - Can existing tools handle it?
   - What's the learning curve?
   - How will it affect project complexity?

3. **Test Before Committing**
   - Create proof-of-concept in separate branch
   - Measure performance impact
   - Verify build and deployment
   - Check cross-platform compatibility

4. **Document Everything**
   - Why was it chosen?
   - How to use it?
   - Integration examples
   - Troubleshooting tips

## Current Stack Summary (v3.1.0)

```
The End The Beginning Tech Stack:
├── Java 17 (Language)
├── JavaFX 20 (UI Framework - Pure Implementation)
├── Maven (Build Tool)
└── CSS (Styling)

Removed in v3.1.0:
✗ FXGL 17.3 (No longer needed)
```

## Recommendations

For contributors and future development:

1. **Stick with Pure JavaFX** for game features (current approach)
2. **Keep it Simple** - avoid unnecessary dependencies
3. **Consider FXGL** only if we need advanced features (particles, complex animations)
4. **Test thoroughly** before integrating new frameworks
5. **Document decisions** in this file

## Questions?

If you're considering adding a new game engine or framework:
1. Open a GitHub issue with the "enhancement" tag
2. Explain the problem it solves
3. Provide links to documentation
4. Discuss alternatives
5. Consider team feedback before proceeding
